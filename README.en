What's WEMI?
------------

  WEMI is a branch of SEMI kernel package using widget.  It is a
  library to provide MIME feature for GNU Emacs based on SEMI API.
  Namely it contains whole features of SEMI thus it is a replacement
  of SEMI.

  MIME is a proposed internet standard for including content and
  headers other than (ASCII) plain text in messages.

	RFC 2045 : Internet Message Bodies
	RFC 2046 : Media Types
	RFC 2047 : Message Header Extensions
	RFC 2048 : MIME Registration Procedures
	RFC 2049 : MIME Conformance

  WEMI has the following features:

	- MIME style multilingual header (RFC 2047)
	- MIME message viewer   (mime-view-mode) (RFC 2045 .. 2049)
	- MIME message composer (mime-edit-mode) (RFC 2045 .. 2049)

  MIME message viewer and composer also support following features:

	- filename handling by Content-Disposition field (RFC 1806)
	- PGP/MIME security Multiparts (RFC 2015)
	- application/pgp (draft-kazu-pgp-mime-00.txt; obsolete)
	- text/richtext (RFC 1521; obsolete; preview only)
	- text/enriched (RFC 1896)

  Notice that this package does not contain MIME extender for any
  MUAs and external methods.  They are released as separated packages.


Required environment
--------------------

  WEMI supports XEmacs 20.3 or later with mule, and Emacs 20.2.

  WEMI does not support anything older than Emacs 19.28 or XEmacs
  19.14.  WEMI also does not support Emacs 19.29 to 19.34, XEmacs
  19.15 or XEmacs 20.2 without mule, but WEMI may work with them.

  If you use Emacs 20, don't set `enable-multibyte-characters' to
  nil. (Maybe non mule setting requires to modify emu.  In addition,
  it is better to use terminal-coding-system feature)

  WEMI requires APEL and MEL package.  Please install them before
  installing it.  APEL package
  is available at:

	ftp://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/GNU/elisp/apel/

  and MEL package is available at:

	ftp://ftp.jaist.ac.jp/pub/GNU/elisp/mime/libs/

  Notice that latest version of XEmacs may have latest version of APEL
  and MEL, so you should not install them.

  PGP/MIME and application/pgp require mailcrypt or tiny-pgp package.

  The package enriched.el is required to compose text/enriched, so if
  you use Emacs anything 19.28 or older (including official version of
  MULE 2.3), WYSIWYG composing for text/enriched is not available.


Installation
------------

	% make install

  You can specify the emacs command name, for example

	% make install EMACS=xemacs

  If `EMACS=...' is omitted, EMACS=emacs is used.

  You can specify the prefix of the directory tree for Emacs Lisp
  programs and shell scripts, for example:

	% make install PREFIX=~/

  If `PREFIX=...' is omitted, the prefix of the directory tree of the
  specified emacs command is used (perhaps /usr/local).

  For example, if PREFIX=/usr/local and EMACS 19.34 is specified, it
  will create the following directory tree:

	/usr/local/share/emacs/19.34/site-lisp/  --- emu
	/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/apel/   --- APEL
	/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/bitmap/ --- BITMAP-MULE
	/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu/     --- MU
	/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mel/    --- MEL
	/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/semi/   --- WEMI

  You can specify site-lisp directory, for example

	% make install LISPDIR=~/share/emacs/lisp

  If `LISPDIR=...' is omitted, site-lisp directory of the specified
  emacs command is used (perhaps /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp or
  /usr/local/lib/xemacs/site-lisp).

  You can specify other optional settings by editing the file
  ${archive}/SEMI-CFG.  Please read ${archive}/README.en and comments
  in ${archive}/SEMI-CFG.


Initialization
--------------

(a) load-path

  If you are using Emacs or Mule, please add directory of emu, apel,
  bitmap, mu, mel and semi to load-path.  If you install by default
  setting, you can write subdirs.el for example:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  (normal-top-level-add-to-load-path
   '("apel" "bitmap" "mu" "mel" "semi"))
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you are using XEmacs, there are no need of setting about
  load-path.

(b) mime-setup

  Please insert the following into your ~/.emacs:

	(load "mime-setup")
